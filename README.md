# Photo Review Helper

Instructions:
Open up Setup.txt and change the necessary lines. Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed or Photo Review Helper will not work! Once you are done with Setup.txt, run PhotoReviewHelper.py. You must not have spaces within the file path to the photos or the names of the photos themselves.

Operation:
Left and right are < and >(, and .). To mark a photo that you like, press m. To find these photos, go into File Explorer and search for whatever you set  the renaming to be(the default is "_GOOD").

Once you have marked a photo, the photo will not be viewable inside Photo Review Helper unless you close and reopen it.

Please note that FileNotFound errors in the Python console window will occur after you mark a photo. These are expected and don't need to be a concern.
